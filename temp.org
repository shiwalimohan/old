					    abstract = {Online perception, behavior, and learning in complex domains require an intelligent agent to quickly and reliably access different
types of knowledge. A cognitive architecture, therefore, must implement a diverse set of memories that are optimized for storing,
accessing, and learning these different types of knowledge. In this paper, we describe a complex Soar agent that uses and learns
multiple types of knowledge while interacting with a human in a real-world domain. Our hypothesis is that a diverse set of memories
is required for the different types of knowledge. We first present the agent’s processing, highlighting the types of knowledge used for
each phase. We then present Soar’s memories and identify which memory is used for each type of knowledge. We also analyze which
properties of each memory make it appropriate for the knowledge it encodes. We conclude with a summary of our analysis. },
