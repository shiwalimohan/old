Learning through instruction is a powerful paradigm for acquiring knowledge because it limits the complexity of the learning task in a variety of ways. To support learning through instruction, the agent must be able to effectively communicate its lack of knowledge to the human, comprehend instructions, and apply them to the ongoing task. We identify some problems of concern when designing instructable agents. We propose an agent design that addresses some of these problems. We instantiate this design in the Soar cognitive architecture and analyze its capabilities on a learning task.},

We present promising results in some instances of the game and identify some problems that might affect learning.},

This paper explores the possible application of Random Indexing in discovering word senses from the text. The words appearing in the text are plotted onto a multi-dimensional Word Space using Random Indexing. The geometric distance between words is used as an indicative of their semantic similarity. Soft Clustering by Committee algorithm (CBC) has been used to constellate similar words. The present work shows that the Word Space model can be used effectively to determine the similarity index required for clustering. The approach does not require parsers, lexicons or any other resources which are traditionally used in sense disambiguation of words. The proposed approach has been applied to TASA corpus and encouraging results have been obtained.},

Semantic similarity scores are computed by mapping the sentences on a semantic space using Random Indexing. Random Indexing, in comparison with other semantic space algorithms, presents a computationally efficient way of implicit dimensionality reduction. It involves inexpensive vector computations such as addition. It thus provides an efficient way to compute similarities between words, sentences and documents. Random Indexing has been used to compute the semantic similarity scores of sentences and graph-based ranking algorithms have been employed to produce an extract of the given text.},

ABSTRACT =      {Computer Games are interesting test beds for research in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Games usually have continuous state spaces, large action spaces and  are characterized by complex relationships between components. Without applying abstraction and generalizations, learning in computer games domain becomes infeasible. Through this work, we investigate some designs that facilitate tractable reinforcement learning in symbolic agents developed using Soar architecture operating in a complex domain, Infinite Mario. Object oriented representations of the environment greatly simplify otherwise complex state spaces. We also demonstrate that imposing hierarchy in problem structure greatly reduces the complexity of the tasks and aids in learning generalized policies that can be transferred across similar tasks.},
