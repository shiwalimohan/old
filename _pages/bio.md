Dr. Shiwali Mohan is a senior member of research staff at Xerox PARC. She studies the design and analysis of collaborative human-AI systems. Her research brings together methods from artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) with insights from human-centered sciences to design systems that can collaborate with humans effectively. Her research has had an inter-disciplinary impact and has been published at venues for research on AI, human cognition, cognitive systems, human-computer interaction (HCI), medical informatics, and AI for social good.

Dr. Mohan has served as a principal investigator and key personnel on grants from DARPA, AFOSR, and ARPA-E as well as has led Xerox research on interactive intelligent systems. Her most recent work on [intelligent coaching systems for health behavior change](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3366501) is one of the first demonstrations of long-term, interactive, adaptive behavior that was evaluated with human trainees in ecological settings. During her [doctoral research](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/111573), she led the development of [Rosie](https://soargroup.github.io/rosie/) - a complex agent with end-to-end behavior including natural language processing, flexible dialog, computer vision, action control, and interactive learning. This research has led to a new challenge problem for AI systems research - [Interactive Task Learning](http://cognet.mit.edu/book/interactive-task-learning). With John Laird, she won the [Blue Sky Award at AAAI 2018](https://cra.org/ccc/learning-fast-and-slow-levels-of-learning-in-general-autonomous-intelligent-agents/) for proposing a novel framework that integrates statistical learning with cognitive reasoning for complex intelligent behavior.

Dr. Mohan received her B.E. in Instrumentation and Control Engineering from Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology, Delhi University. She received her M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor with a focus on artificial intelligence.

In her free time, Shiwali loves to dance and is a principal dancer for an Indian-American fusion dance company in the Bay area.
