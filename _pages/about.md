<p style="text-align:justify">I am an AI systems scientist at the <a href="https://www.parc.com/"> Palo Alto Research Center</a>. I study <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.07089.pdf" target="_blank">human-aware</a> AI - how to design intelligent interactive systems that model, learn, and reason about their human collaborators. I am
especially interested in methods for effective and robust human-agent collaborative behavior in real-world settings. My research spans artificial intelligence & machine learning and leverages insights about human behavior from
cognitive science, linguistics, and economics.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">I have designed intelligent collaborative agents for a variety of application domains including <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.01962" target="_blank">general</a> <a href="https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/viewPaper/17261" target="_blank">purpose</a> <a href="https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8630/8446" target="_blank">robots</a>, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3366501" target="_blank">preventive</a> <a href="https://www.jmir.org/2017/11/e397/" target="_blank">healthcare</a>,  <a href="https://www.jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/11352" target="_blank">sustainable <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3306618.3314271" target="_blank">transportation</a>, and <a href="http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2327/IUI19WS-USER2AGENT-1.pdf" target="_blank">augmented reality learning</a>. I am particularly motivated to build intelligent collaborative technology for <a href="https://cra.org/ccc/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/04/AI-for-Social-Good-Workshop-Report.pdf"> social good and public welfare</a>. My work is interdisciplinary and has been published at venues for research on artificial intelligence, human cognition, human-computer interaction, and medical informatics & engineering.
