<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">


<p>
I am a doctoral candidate in <a href="http://www.cse.umich.edu/">Computer Science and Engineering</a> at <a href="http://www.umich.edu/">The University of Michigan</a>, Ann Arbor. I have been working with Professor <a href="http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/laird/">John Laird</a>
on the <a href="http://sitemaker.umich.edu/soar/home">Soar Cognitive Architecture</a> in the <a href="http://www.eecs.umich.edu/ai/">Michigan AI Lab</a> since 2009.
</p>
<p>
I am interested in situated language for intelligent agents and the
relationship of language processing (comprehension, acquisition,
generation and interaction) with other cognitive capabilities such as
perception, procedural and declarative knowledge, and learning. 
</p>
<p>
My past work has focused on cognitive agents that can learn to
navigate new, complex environments. We have looked at agents that
start with minimal background knowledge about an environment and build
relevant, relational structures using reinforcement learning in the
<a href="http://2009.rl-competition.org/mario.php">Infinite Mario</a> RL domain.
</p>
<p>
I am from India, where I received an undergraduate degree in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumentation">Instrumentation and Control Engineering</a> from <a href="http://www.du.ac.in/index.php?id=4">University of Delhi</a>. After four years of struggling with control equations and
differential calculus, I ended up loving programming and other geeky,
Computer Science-y things. I worked with <a href="http://in.careers.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! India</a> as a software
engineer on their Strategic Data Solutions team for some time, before
deciding to denounce the real world, and the money that comes with it
and became a graduate student.

<p>I am involved with the grounded language acquisition project
at Michigan. Apart from the Soar group at University of Michigan, the
team also includes <a href="http://april.eecs.umich.edu/">APRIL at Michigan</a> and <a href="http://www.soartech.com/">SoarTech</a>.
</p>
<p>
I am currently studying comprehension of sentences by exploiting
non-linguistic context such as perceptual information, procedural
knowledge and semantic information.
</p>
<p>
I have designed and implemented an interaction model for agents
instantiated in Soar cognitive architecture that allows limited
mixed-initiative interaction with an instructor. The
agents can then derive generally applicable procedural knowledge from
a history of interactions (available in episodic/semantic memory of
the agent) using situated explanation.

Learning through instruction is a powerful paradigm for acquiring knowledge because it limits the complexity of the learning task in a variety of ways. To support learning through instruction, the agent must be able to effectively communicate its lack of knowledge to the human, comprehend instructions, and apply them to the ongoing task. Weidentify some problems of concern when designing instructable agents. We propose an agent design that addresses some of these problems. We instantiate this design in the Soar cognitive architecture and analyze its capabilities on a learning task.},

This paper explores the possible application of Random Indexing in discovering word senses from the text. The words appearing in the text are plotted onto a multi-dimensional Word Space using Random Indexing. The geometric distance between words is used as an indicative of their semantic similarity. Soft Clustering by Committee algorithm (CBC) has been used to constellate similar words. The present work shows that the Word Space model can be used effectively to determine the similarity index required for clustering. The approach does not require parsers, lexicons or any other resources which are traditionally used in sense disambiguation of words. The proposed approach has been applied to TASA corpus and encouraging results have been obtained.},

Semantic similarity scores are computed by mapping the sentences on a semantic space using Random Indexing. Random Indexing, in comparison with other semantic space algorithms, presents a computationally efficient way of implicit dimensionality reduction. It involves inexpensive vector computations such as addition. It thus provides an efficient way to compute similarities between words, sentences and documents. Random Indexing has been used to compute the semantic similarity scores of sentences and graph-based ranking algorithms have been employed to produce an extract of the given text.},

Games usually have continuous state spaces, large action spaces and  are characterized by complex relationships between components. Without applying abstraction and generalizations, learning in computer games domain becomes infeasible. Through this work, we investigate some designs that facilitate tractable reinforcement learning in symbolic agents developed using Soar architecture operating in a complex domain, Infinite Mario. Object oriented representations of the environment greatly simplify otherwise complex state spaces. We also demonstrate that imposing hierarchy in problem structure greatly reduces the complexity of the tasks and aids in learning generalized policies that can be transferred across similar tasks.},
