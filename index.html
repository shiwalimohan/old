<p>
I am a doctoral candidate in <a href="http://www.cse.umich.edu/">Computer Science and Engineering</a> at <a href="http://www.umich.edu/">The
University of Michigan</a>, Ann Arbor. I have been collaborating with <a href="http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/laird/">John
Laird</a> on the design and study of interactive agents and robots.
</p>

<p>
My current work focuses on designing cognitive robots that can
communicate with their human partners using natural language and can
expand their knowledge and skill set by engaging the human in
instructional learning. The work looks at several interesting HRI
challenges including embodied language comprehension, interactive
collaboration, and active, agent-driven learning. The agents are
developed in <a href="http://sitemaker.umich.edu/soar/home">Soar</a> - a cognitive architecture for designing generally
intelligent agents. In past, I have worked on relational reinforcement
learning agents for the <a href="http://www.ultimatearcade.com/game/infinite-mario">Infinite Mario</a> domain.
</p>

<p>
I am from India, where I received an undergraduate degree in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumentation">Instrumentation and Control Engineering</a> from <a href="http://www.du.ac.in/index.php?id=4">University of
Delhi</a>. After graduating, I worked for <a href="http://in.careers.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! India</a> as a software
engineer on media analytics and strategic data solutions for a year.

Intelligent agents are becoming pervasive in human society. From
personal assistants such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siri">Siri</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/landing/now/">Google Now</a> to smart robots such
as <a href="http://www.rethinkrobotics.com/products/baxter/">Baxter</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiva_Systems">Kiva systems</a>, several types of intelligent agents are
beginning to contribute to a wide range of human activities. Although
useful, these agents have to be pre-programmed by trained engineers
with a set desired behaviors, limiting their use. We are interested in
developing intelligent taskable agents that can be 'programmed' to
perform new tasks by naive human users. To this end, we are
investigating learning from natural language instruction for
intelligent agent embodied in a robotic framework. Our work looks at
how a robotic agent can exploit interactions with a human collaborator
to learn more about its world including how to categorize and describe
perceptual properties of objects, how to use spatial relationships
between objects for goal-oriented behavior, how to generate subtasks
while executing complex tasks, and how to represent and play novel
games.

<p>
There are several challenging questions that must be answered to
design a language module for intelligent agents, including those
pertaining to situated comprehension, intention assignment, dialog
management, articulation etc. Our ongoing work focuses on questions
that arise in designing language comprehension mechanisms for
intelligent agents. We are developing comprehension models that
implement a theory of translating lexical items to representations of
beliefs, knowledge, and experience that are external to the linguistic
system. We are interested in exploring how extra-linguistic contexts
influence language processing, alleviating ambiguities and
insufficient information prevalent in natural language.

<p>
Cognitive architectures provide an integrated computational theory for
intelligent behavior. They implement short-/long-term memories to store
an agent's beliefs, goals, and knowledge and functional processes that
operate on these structures to generate useful behavior or acquire
knowledge structures through experience. Several architectures
incorporate perceptual and motor modules. Cognitive architectures,
therefore, are a useful framework to study design of intelligent
adaptive collaborative agents and robots.

<p>
Computer games are interesting test beds for research in reinforcement
learning. Skill-based games such as <a href="http://www.ultimatearcade.com/game/infinite-mario">Infinite Mario</a> usually have
continuous state spaces, large action spaces and are characterized by
complex relationships between their components. Without applying
appropriate abstractions and generalizations, RL in computer games
becomes infeasible. Relational representations in reinforcement
learning allow for the use of structural information like the objects
and their features and the relationships between them in the
description of value functions. In this research, we explored
relational representations and control hierarchies that impose
structure on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARSA">SARSA</a> and consequently make learning feasible. We have
shown that relational representations allow for the inclusion of
background knowledge (about both state and actions) which can be used
to guide learning.

abstract = {This paper discusses the challenge of designing instructable agents that can learn through interaction with a human expert. Learning through instruction is a powerful paradigm for acquiring knowledge because it limits the complexity of the learning task in a variety of ways. To support learning through instruction, the agent must be able to effectively communicate its lack of knowledge to the human, comprehend instructions, and apply them to the ongoing task. Weidentify some problems of concern when designing instructable agents. We propose an agent design that addresses some of these problems. We instantiate this design in the Soar cognitive architecture and analyze its capabilities on a learning task.},

Learning to play an action game can be divided into two distinct but related problems, learning an object-related behavior and selecting a primitive action. We propose a framework that allows for the use of reinforcement learning for both of these problems. We present promising results in some instances of the game and identify some problems that might affect learning.},

title = {Discovering Word Senses from Text using Random Indexing},
booktitle = {Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Computational linguistics and Intelligent Text Processing},
abstract = {Random Indexing is a novel technique for dimensionality reduction while creating Word Space model from a given text. This paper explores the possible application of Random Indexing in discovering word senses from the text. The words appearing in the text are plotted onto a multi-dimensional Word Space using Random Indexing. The geometric distance between words is used as an indicative of their semantic similarity. Soft Clustering by Committee algorithm (CBC) has been used to constellate similar words. The present work shows that the Word Space model can be used effectively to determine the similarity index required for clustering. The approach does not require parsers, lexicons or any other resources which are traditionally used in sense disambiguation of words. The proposed approach has been applied to TASA corpus and encouraging results have been obtained.},

booktitle ={Proceeding of the 19th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence},
abstract = {This paper presents a summarization technique for text documents exploiting the semantic similarity between sentences to remove the redundancy from the text. Semantic similarity scores are computed by mapping the sentences on a semantic space using Random Indexing. Random Indexing, in comparison with other semantic space algorithms, presents a computationally efficient way of implicit dimensionality reduction. It involves inexpensive vector computations such as addition. It thus provides an efficient way to compute similarities between words, sentences and documents. Random Indexing has been used to compute the semantic similarity scores of sentences and graph-based ranking algorithms have been employed to produce an extract of the given text.},

ABSTRACT =      {Computer Games are interesting test beds for research in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Games usually have continuous state spaces, large action spaces and  are characterized by complex relationships between components. Without applying abstraction and generalizations, learning in computer games domain becomes infeasible. Through this work, we investigate some designs that facilitate tractable reinforcement learning in symbolic agents developed using Soar architecture operating in a complex domain, Infinite Mario. Object oriented representations of the environment greatly simplify otherwise complex state spaces. We also demonstrate that imposing hierarchy in problem structure greatly reduces the complexity of the tasks and aids in learning generalized policies that can be transferred across similar tasks.},
