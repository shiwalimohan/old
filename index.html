                                        interested in designing
                                        intelligent agents and systems
                                        that can communicate,
                                        interact, and collaborate with
                                        humans in various
                                        capacities. My research spans
                                        artificial intelligence, agent
                                        design and learning, cognitive

					<p> I recently defended my
					thesis titled <em> From Verbs
					to Tasks: An Integrated
					Account of Learning Tasks from
					Situated Interactive
					Instruction</em> at the
					University of Michigan, Ann
					Arbor. It focuses on cognitive
					robots that can communicate
					with their human partners
					using natural language and can
					expand their knowledge and
					skill set by engaging the
					human in instructional
					learning. This looks at
					several interesting HRI
					challenges including embodied
					language comprehension,
					interactive collaboration, and
					active, agent-driven learning.

						  Although useful,
						  these agents have to
						  be pre-programmed by
						  trained engineers
						  with a set desired
						  behaviors, limiting
						  their use. We are
						  interested in
						  developing
						  intelligent taskable
						  agents that can be
						  'programmed' to
						  perform new tasks by
						  naive human
						  users. To this end,
						  we are investigating
						  learning from
						  natural language
						  instruction for
						  intelligent agent
						  embodied in a
						  robotic
						  framework. Our work
						  looks at how a
						  robotic agent can
						  exploit interactions
						  with a human
						  collaborator to
						  learn more about its
						  world including how
						  to categorize and
						  describe perceptual
						  properties of
						  objects, how to use
						  spatial
						  relationships
						  between objects for
						  goal-oriented

						  There are several
						  challenging
						  questions that must
						  be answered to
						  design a language
						  module for
						  intelligent agents,
						  including those
						  pertaining to
						  situated
						  comprehension,
						  intention
						  assignment, dialog
						  management,
						  articulation
						  etc. Our ongoing
						  work focuses on
						  questions that arise
						  in designing
						  language
						  comprehension
						  mechanisms for
						  intelligent
						  agents. We are
						  developing
						  comprehension and
						  generation models
						  that generate
						  meaning by
						  associating amodal
						  lexical symbols to
						  modal
						  representations of
						  beliefs, knowledge,
						  and
						  experience. These
						  representations are
						  external to the
						  linguistic system
						  and are used by the
						  agent to perceive,
						  reason about, learn
						  from, and manipulate
						  their
						  environments. We are
						  exploring how
						  extra-linguistic
						  contexts influence
						  language processing
						  and their utility in
						  alleviating
						  ambiguities and
						  under-specification
						  prevalent in natural
						  language. </p>

						    Cognitive architectures provide an integrated computational theory for intelligent behavior. They implement short-/long-term memories to store an agent's beliefs, goals, and knowledge and functional processes that operate on these structures to generate useful behavior or acquire knowledge structures through experience. Several architectures incorporate perceptual and motor modules. Cognitive architectures, therefore, are a useful framework to study design of intelligent adaptive collaborative agents and robots.

						    <p>Computer games are interesting test beds for research in reinforcement
learning. Skill-based games such as <a href="http://www.ultimatearcade.com/game/infinite-mario">Infinite Mario</a> usually have
continuous state spaces, large action spaces and are characterized by
complex relationships between their components. Without applying
appropriate abstractions and generalizations, RL in computer games
becomes infeasible. Relational representations in reinforcement
learning allow for the use of structural information like the objects
and their features and the relationships between them in the
description of value functions. In this research, we explored
relational representations and control hierarchies that impose
structure on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARSA">SARSA</a> and consequently make learning feasible. We have
shown that relational representations allow for the inclusion of
background knowledge (about both state and actions) which can be used
								to guide learning.</p>

					    abstract={Intelligent collaborative agents are becoming common in the human society. From virtual
					    assistants such as Siri and Google Now to assistive robots, they contribute to human activities
in a variety of ways. As they become more pervasive, the challenge of customizing
them to a variety of environments and tasks becomes critical. It is infeasible for engineers
to program them for each individual use. Our research aims at building interactive robots
and agents that adapt to new environments autonomously by interacting with human
users using natural modalities.
This dissertation studies the problem of learning novel tasks from human-agent dialog.
We propose a novel approach for interactive task learning, situated interactive instruction
(SII), and investigate approaches to three computational challenges that arise in designing
SII agents: situated comprehension, mixed-initiative interaction, and interactive task learning.
We propose a novel mixed-modality grounded representation for task verbs which
encompasses their lexical, semantic, and task-oriented aspects. This representation is useful
in situated comprehension and can be learned through human-agent interactions. We
introduce the Indexical Model of comprehension that can exploit extra-linguistic contexts
for resolving semantic ambiguities in situated comprehension of task commands. The
Indexical model is integrated with a mixed-initiative interaction model that facilitates a
flexible task-oriented human-agent dialog. This dialog serves as the basis of interactive
task learning. We propose an interactive variation of explanation-based learning that can
acquire the proposed representation. We demonstrate that our learning paradigm is efficient,
can transfer knowledge between structurally similar tasks, integrates agent-driven exploration with instructional learning, and can acquire several tasks. The methods proposed
in this thesis are integrated in Rosie - a generally instructable agent developed in
the Soar cognitive architecture and embodied on a table-top robot.},

This Indexical Model incorporates multiple information sources, including perceptions, domain knowledge, and short-term and long-term experiences during comprehension. We show that exploiting diverse information sources can alleviate ambiguities that arise from contextual use of underspecific referring expressions and unexpressed argument alternations of verbs. The model is being used to support linguistic interactions in Rosie, an agent implemented in Soar that learns from instruction.},

					    abstract = {Online perception, behavior, and learning in complex domains require an intelligent agent to quickly and reliably access different
types of knowledge. A cognitive architecture, therefore, must implement a diverse set of memories that are optimized for storing,
accessing, and learning these different types of knowledge. In this paper, we describe a complex Soar agent that uses and learns
multiple types of knowledge while interacting with a human in a real-world domain. Our hypothesis is that a diverse set of memories
is required for the different types of knowledge. We first present the agent’s processing, highlighting the types of knowledge used for
each phase. We then present Soar’s memories and identify which memory is used for each type of knowledge. We also analyze which
properties of each memory make it appropriate for the knowledge it encodes. We conclude with a summary of our analysis. },

Learning through instruction is a powerful paradigm for acquiring knowledge because it limits the complexity of the learning task in a variety of ways. To support learning through instruction, the agent must be able to effectively communicate its lack of knowledge to the human, comprehend instructions, and apply them to the ongoing task. Weidentify some problems of concern when designing instructable agents. We propose an agent design that addresses some of these problems. We instantiate this design in the Soar cognitive architecture and analyze its capabilities on a learning task.},

ABSTRACT =      {Computer Games are interesting test beds for research in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Games usually have continuous state spaces, large action spaces and  are characterized by complex relationships between components. Without applying abstraction and generalizations, learning in computer games domain becomes infeasible. Through this work, we investigate some designs that facilitate tractable reinforcement learning in symbolic agents developed using Soar architecture operating in a complex domain, Infinite Mario. Object oriented representations of the environment greatly simplify otherwise complex state spaces. We also demonstrate that imposing hierarchy in problem structure greatly reduces the complexity of the tasks and aids in learning generalized policies that can be transferred across similar tasks.},

This paper explores the possible application of Random Indexing in discovering word senses from the text. The words appearing in the text are plotted onto a multi-dimensional Word Space using Random Indexing. The geometric distance between words is used as an indicative of their semantic similarity. Soft Clustering by Committee algorithm (CBC) has been used to constellate similar words. The present work shows that the Word Space model can be used effectively to determine the similarity index required for clustering. The approach does not require parsers, lexicons or any other resources which are traditionally used in sense disambiguation of words. The proposed approach has been applied to TASA corpus and encouraging results have been obtained.},

abstract = {This paper presents a summarization technique for text documents exploiting the semantic similarity between sentences to remove the redundancy from the text. Semantic similarity scores are computed by mapping the sentences on a semantic space using Random Indexing. Random Indexing, in comparison with other semantic space algorithms, presents a computationally efficient way of implicit dimensionality reduction. It involves inexpensive vector computations such as addition. It thus provides an efficient way to compute similarities between words, sentences and documents. Random Indexing has been used to compute the semantic similarity scores of sentences and graph-based ranking algorithms have been employed to produce an extract of the given text.},
