	abstract = {This paper discusses the challenge of designing instructable agents that can learn through interaction with a human expert. Learning through instruction is a powerful paradigm for acquiring knowledge because it limits the complexity of the learning task in a variety of ways. To support learning through instruction, the agent must be able to effectively communicate its lack of knowledge to the human, comprehend instructions, and apply them to the ongoing task. Weidentify some problems of concern when designing instructable agents. We propose an agent design that addresses some of these problems. We instantiate this design in the Soar cognitive architecture and analyze its capabilities on a learning task.},

Learning to play an action game can be divided intotwo distinct but related problems, learning an object-relatedbehavior and selecting a primitive action. We propose a framework that allows for the use of reinforcement learning for both ofthese problems. We present promising results in some instances of thegame and identify some problems that might affect learning.},

 title = {Discovering Word Senses from Text using Random Indexing},
 booktitle = {Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Computational linguistics and Intelligent Text Processing},
 abstract = {Random Indexing is a novel technique for dimensionality reduction while creating Word Space model from a given text. This paper explores the possible application of Random Indexing in discovering word senses from the text. The words appearing in the text are plotted onto a multi-dimensional Word Space using Random Indexing. The geometric distance between words is used as an indicative of their semantic similarity. Soft Clustering by Committee algorithm (CBC) has been used to constellate similar words. The present work shows that the Word Space model can be used effectively to determine the similarity index required for clustering. The approach does not require parsers, lexicons or any other resources which are traditionally used in sense disambiguation of words. The proposed approach has been applied to TASA corpus and encouraging results have been obtained.},

booktitle ={Proceeding of the 19th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence},
abstract = {This paper presents a summarization technique for text documents exploiting the semantic similarity between sentences to remove the redundancy from the text. Semantic similarity scores are computed by mapping the sentences on a semantic space using Random Indexing. Random Indexing, in comparison with other semantic space algorithms, presents a computationally efficient way of implicit dimensionality reduction. It involves inexpensive vector computations such as addition. It thus provides an efficient way to compute similarities between words, sentences and documents. Random Indexing has been used to compute the semantic similarity scores of sentences and graph-based ranking algorithms have been employed to produce an extract of the given text.},

Games usually have continuous state spaces, large action spaces and  are characterized by complex relationships between components. Without applying abstraction and generalizations, learning in computer games domain becomes infeasible. Through this work, we investigate some designs that facilitate tractable reinforcement learning in symbolic agents developed using Soar architecture operating in a complex domain, Infinite Mario. Object oriented representations of the environment greatly simplify otherwise complex state spaces. We also demonstrate that imposing hierarchy in problem structure greatly reduces the complexity of the tasks and aids in learning generalized policies that can be transferred across similar tasks.},

       abstract = {Electroencephalography (EEG), which contains cortical potentials during various mental processes, can be used to provide neural input signals to activate a brain machine interface (BMI). The eﬀectiveness of such an EEG-based prosthetic system would rely on correct classiﬁcation of executed motor signals from imagined motor movement signals; an executed motor signal should initiate movement in the artiﬁcial limb while signals from motor imagery should be ﬁltered out. This work evaluates the performance of features based on average EEG signal power contained in diﬀerent frequency bands in order to distinguish between the executed and imagined EEG signals. We also investigate Independent Component Analysis (ICA) as a scheme to remove irrelevant artifacts from the EEG signals. Results demonstrate that using EEG for classiﬁcation can be performed eﬀectively; however results vary signiﬁcantly from patient to patient suggesting that BMI must highly specialized for an individual patient.},
