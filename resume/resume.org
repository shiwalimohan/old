* Research Experience
 Graduate Student Research Assistant to Professor John E. Laird \hfill
 /August 2010 - Present/\\
\textsc{University of Michigan}, Ann Arbor\\
/Learning with Human-Agent Interaction/  \\
Designed and implemented an interaction model for agents instantiated in Soar
cognitive architecture that allows  limited mixed-initiative
interaction with an instructor. The agents can derived generally
applicable procedural knowledge from a history of interactions
(available in episodic/semantic memory of the agent) using situated explanation.
